\page Installation Installation Instructions

## Windows

The Windows executable package contains all required dependencies and does not need administrative privileges for installation. This is a standard MSI installer. If a security prompt comes up, click on "Run Anyway".

## Linux

- Linux users have a CaPTk AppImage available called `CaPTk_${Version}.bin`. 
- To run the AppImage, first open a terminal in the same directory as the .bin file.
- You will want to make sure it is runnable as an executable with the following command:
\verbatim
chmod +x CaPTk_${Version}.bin
\endverbatim
- Run the following command to start CaPTk:
\verbatim
./CaPTk_${Version}.bin
\endverbatim
- Follow prompts to install.

## macOS

- Install <b>LLVM</b> using [Brew](https://brew.sh/) by running the following command on the terminal:
\verbatim
brew install llvm
\endverbatim
- Users will download the ".pkg" file from NITRC; double-click the file. 
- If there is a window saying that this is an "unidentified developer", hit "OK" and then go to "System Preferences > Security and Privacy" and you need to click on "Open Anyway" beside the "CaPTk_$version.pkg" (this will prompt for your password).
- Double click on the pkg file and click on "Open". This will guide you through the installation screen with licensing information.
- Before installation begins, you may be prompted for your password again.
- You will find CaPTk under your "Applications" folder and you can delete the disk image.
